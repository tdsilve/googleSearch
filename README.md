# Google Search Clone

Link to this project: https://tdsilve.github.io/googleSearchClone/

The main goal of this project is to replicate Google Search page and write a form that send data to Google's server. So you can make a search by using "I'm Feeling Lucky" and "Google Search" buttons.
You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.
